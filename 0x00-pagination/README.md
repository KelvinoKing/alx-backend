## Project Description

The project involves creating backend functionality to paginate datasets efficiently. Pagination is a common technique used in web development to split large datasets into smaller, more manageable parts to improve performance and user experience.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will gain knowledge and skills in:

- Implementing pagination techniques using simple page and page_size parameters
- Paginating datasets with hypermedia metadata (HATEOAS)
- Implementing deletion-resilient pagination techniques

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS environment
- Python 3.7
- pycodestyle style for code formatting
- Proper documentation for modules, classes, and methods
- Type annotations for functions and coroutines

## Tasks Overview

1. **Simple Helper Function**
   - Implement a function to calculate the start and end index for pagination.

2. **Simple Pagination**
   - Implement a class to paginate a dataset of popular baby names.
   - Provide functionality to retrieve a specific page of the dataset based on page number and page size.

3. **Hypermedia Pagination**
   - Extend the previous implementation to include hypermedia metadata in pagination results.
   - Return a dictionary containing page information, including page size, current page number, next page number, previous page number, and total number of pages.

4. **Deletion-Resilient Hypermedia Pagination**
   - Implement a method to handle pagination in a deletion-resilient manner.
   - Ensure that even if rows are removed from the dataset between queries, users receive consistent pagination results.
